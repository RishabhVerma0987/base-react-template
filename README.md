# Base React Template

This is a base template for a React project.
Idea here is to build a Single SPA React starter kit that is good for small to medium sized projects.

## Template use cases

- Small to medium sized projects.
- Could be scaled to large projects with micro frontend and monorepos.
- SPA Client side rendered applications.

> It includes modern tools for **improved DX** and **performance** which is **stable** and **good for production**.

## Base tooling

- `node` (V22) as our _runtime_.
- `pnpm` as our _package manager_.
- `vite` as our _build tool_.
- `react` (V19) as our _UI library_.

## Committing
